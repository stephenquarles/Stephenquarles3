# Glitch & Grit — Repo Starter (v2)

## Upload order (exact steps)
1. Create a new **public** repo on GitHub (e.g., `glitch_grit_project`).
2. Click **Add file → Upload files**.
3. Drag the **contents** of this folder (NOT the folder itself) into GitHub:
   - `index.html`
   - `intro.html`
   - `texture.html`
   - `echo.html`
   - `images/` (the whole folder)
4. Commit the upload.
5. Go to **Settings → Pages → Build and deployment**:
   - Source: **Deploy from a branch**
   - Branch: **main** and **/** (root)
6. Wait a minute, then open:
   - `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/`

### Notes
- `index.html` must be at the repo root (prevents 404).
- Images are already referenced via `images/...` in the HTML.
- Edit any text by clicking a file → **Edit** in GitHub.
